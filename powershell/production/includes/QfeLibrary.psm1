Function New-QfePatch {
 <#
 .SYNOPSIS
 Create the QFE metadata file on the server
 .DESCRIPTION
 This function will create an XML metadata file for each QFE for each affected OS. This
 is not an automatic action, the admin will need to provide all the details for the
 hotfix (QFE).

 The intended workflow would be an issue is identified on one or more servers. The issue
 is researched and a hotfix is found that addresses this issue. The admin then writes a
 simple test that will evaluate to true or false depending on the test (eg. checking
 the version information of a file is common). Once the test is confirmed against an
 affected server, the patch is downloaded to a central respository, and all the information
 is passed to this function to create an XML file for later use.
 .PARAMETER URL
 This is the URL from the Microsoft support site that contains the details
 regarding this hotfix.
 .PARAMETER KB
 This is the numeric article for the hotfix. This information is used to
 generate the QfeId, as well as a filter for other functions.
 .PARAMETER OS
 This is the OS of the target system. Ideally this would be the output of
 Get-WmiObject -Query 'Select Caption from Win32_OperatingSystem'. This is what
 in other functions within the library. If there is a difference then lookups
 won't work as expected.
 .PARAMETER Arch
 This would be the 3 to 4 character representation that is used for process architecture
 x86, x64, ia64
 .PARAMETER Test
 This should be a simple test that would evaluate out to true or false. For example
 KB981314 makes a change to cimwin32.dll, as a result the private revision number
 for the file changes. The article displays what the new version should be, so it's
 a simple get-item to check the existing version number and compare it to the new. If
 they don't match, then we need to update, otherwise no update needed.
 .PARAMETER Answer
 This is what we test against. If the answer is 20683, then any value other than 20683
 results in a false, which means the patch should be applied.
 .PARAMETER QfeServer
 This is the path to where the QFEs and their metadata should be stored. It can be in
 the form of a shared folder:
 \\fs\share\hotfixes

 or as a local path:
 C:\hotfixes
 .EXAMPLE
 New-QfePatch
 -URL 'http://support.microsoft.com/kb/981314'
 -KB 981314
 -OS (Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem |Select-Object -Property Caption -ExpandProperty Caption)
 -Arch 'x64'
 -Test '(Get-Item -Path C:\Windows\System32\wbem\cimwin32.dll).VersionInfo.FilePrivatePart'
 -Answer 20683

 .SYNOPSIS
 Verify that the hotfix is needed for this system.
 .DESCRIPTION
 This function will read in the metadata from the provided QfeId and extract
 the test and answer properties. This test doesn't install the patch it simply
 runs the test and compares it to the answer. If they don't equal then the patch
 is assumed to be needed.

 Whether the hotfix acutally gets installed is handled by wusa in a seperate
 function.
 .PARAMETER QfeId
 This is the generated Id based on the KB, OS and Arch. To get a list of
 QFE's you can run Get-QfeList.

Function Get-QfeList {
 <#
 .SYNOPSIS
 Get a list of available QFE's from the server.
 .DESCRIPTION
 This function will return a list of available QFE's that are available. The default
 action is to return only a list of QFE's where the client OS matches the OS property
 of QFE metadata file. This behaviour can be overridden by the -All switch.

 In addition to returning a list of available QFE's, you can also specify the -Download
 switch to optionally download all the QFE's or just the ones for your OS.
 .PARAMETER QfeServer
 This is the path to where the QFEs and their metadata should be stored. It can be in
 the form of a shared folder:
 \\fs\share\hotfixes

 or as a local path:
 C:\hotfixes
 .PARAMETER All
 When present the list of QFE's returned is filtered against the client OS. It's
 important that the client OS matches the OS property of the QFE.

 See the help for New-QfePatch for more information about the OS property.
 .PARAMETER Download
 When present the list of QFE's will be downloaded locally to the client.
 .PARAMETER LocalPath
 This is the location to where the hotfix files and their metadata will be
 downloaded to. The default location is C:\HotFixes, if it doesn't exist it
 will be created.

 This folder only get's created, if -Download is present.
 .EXAMPLE
 Get-QfeList

Function Install-QfePatch {
 <#
 .SYNOPSIS
 Install a hotfix on the local computer
 .DESCRIPTION
 This function will install a hotfix on the local computer using WUSA.exe. For more
 information on WUSA please see the related links at the bottom of this help file.

 Installation is completely handled by WUSA. Regardless of what Test-QfePatch returns
 WUSA has the last say in whether the patch is needed. It's beyond my depth to any more
 than just a simple test to check.

 We query the WMI class Win32_QuickFixEngineering to see if the hotfix is already installed
 before we do anything. If it exists in the list, we're done. If not, we install the patch.
 For verification I pass the /log paramter to WUSA so a logfile is generated in the
 same location as the hotfix. If there are any error's reported in the log those are
 returned at the end of the processing.

 I think the most common error would be
 Windows update  could not be installed because of error 2149842967

 This indicates that the hotfix is not needed for this computer. Most likely the computer
 has already been patched, or has a service pack installed with the included hotfix.
 .PARAMETER QfeFilename
 This is the XML metadata file that gets copied to the local computer when Get-QfeList -Download
 is used. You can install these one at a time, or pass them over the pipeline.
 .EXAMPLE
 Get-ChildItem C:\Hotfixes\ |Install-QfePatch

 Description
 -----------
 This example passes in all filese stored in the Hotfixes folder. The function will only
 process an XML file, and we assume the only XML files are the ones we created with the
 New-QfePatch function.
 .EXAMPLE
 Install-QfePatch -QfeFilename C:\Hotfixes\977944-Microsoft-Windows-7-Enterprise-x64.xml

 Description
 -----------
 This example shows installing a specific hotfix.
