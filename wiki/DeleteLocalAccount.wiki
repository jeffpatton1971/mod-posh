NOTES
    
    
        This script requires the ComputerManagement and ActiveDirectoryManagement libraries
        The script registers it's name as an event-source on the source computer and writes
        events to the application log.
        This script assumes the includes folder is a subfolder of the current directory, if that
        is not the case you may receive a FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException when
        attempting to dot-source in the libraries.
