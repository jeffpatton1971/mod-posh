SYNTAX
    C:\mod-posh\powershell\production\Get-FreeDiskSpace.ps1 [[-FileName] <Object>] [<CommonParamete
    rs>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This script works in conjunction with an Event Trigger on the System
    event on our file servers. This script queries the System log for 
    EventID 2013, and returns the drive letter from the most recent 
    event. 
    
    This should be the same event that triggered this script to
    run in the first place.
    
    It outputs an XML file to the StorageReports directory which exists 
    on both nodes of the file server cluster.
