NAME
    C:\mod-posh\powershell\production\New-IscsiDriveMaps.ps1
    
SYNOPSIS
    Create iSCSI drive maps on one or more servers
    
SYNTAX
    C:\mod-posh\powershell\production\New-IscsiDriveMaps.ps1 [-FileName] <Object> [[-ServerName] <O
    bject>] [-Favorites] <Object> [-LoginTarget] <Object> [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Making life easier by creating the iSCSI drive mappings via Powershell. 
    However, the Microsoft Initiator isn't natively powershell enabled, the calls
    must be made through the command line interface of iscsicli.exe.
    This script addresses the pain involved in dealing with larger numbers of servers, 
    in our data center this includes numerous Hyper-V Clusters with 
    Clustered Shared Volumes where we'd have quite a lot of UI clicking to do.

NOTES
    
    
        This script was originally written by Dynamic IT, and the source URL is the second link.
        I really liked the script and felt that the original could use a little more PowerShell
        loving, so I took nearly all the original code and as best as I could took in the 
        original intent.
        
        I noted that it appeared that they used a couple of values, Favorites and LoginTargets 
        as more or less switches. I set those as a parameter and defaulted to true, so that
        code runs by default.
        
        The VolumeMaps code was more or less the same, I left the ServerName parameter blank
        and if it's present we then filter the CSV by the ServerName. This also took out the 
        need to check if only 1 arg was passed.
