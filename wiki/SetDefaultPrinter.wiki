SYNTAX

    s>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This script is run as a user logon script. The idea behind it is that not everyone needs the 
    same default printer, so this script checks the current user ($env:UserName) if they are listed
    in the PrinterMappingFile then the specific printer they requested as mapped to them.
    

PARAMETERS

        This is a .CSV file that contains a user column and a printer column. The user column shoul
        d be
        labled as Name and the printer column should be labeled as Printer. This file is processed 
        by
        the script to map a specific printer to a specific user.
