NAME
    C:\mod-posh\powershell\production\New-PrintJob.ps1
    
SYNOPSIS
    Log a print job to a file.
    
SYNTAX
    C:\mod-posh\powershell\production\New-PrintJob.ps1 [[-FileName] <Object>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This script works in conjunction with an Event Trigger on the PrintService
    event on our print servers. This script queries the Microsoft-Windows-PrintService/Operational
    log for EventID 307, and returns the drive letter from the most recent event. 
    
    This should be the same event that triggered this script to
    run in the first place.
    
    It appends to a CSV log file if it exists, or creates a new file if it doesn't.
